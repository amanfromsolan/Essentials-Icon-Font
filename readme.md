Hi! Thanks for downloading Essential Icon Font.
The font is completely free to use in your projects, with or without attribution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with using it on desktop (Sketch, Adobe XD, Invision Studio, Figma and any of the 52 billion design tools), install the Essentials.ttf file in the "fonts" folder.

After you have successfully installed it, open your preferred design software, and create a type layer. Select the "Essential" font and try typing "arrow-left", it should *magically* make an arrow left. You can find all of these keywords on smplkit.com (scroll to the bottom, you can also search any icon).
